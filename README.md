# NaiveBayesClassifier
#Configuration instructions:
#ModelAccuracy.py contains
#NB_MultiClass.py contains Bernoulli Naive Bayes model implemented from scratch and all the preprocessing with features.
#When you run the MultiClass.py, it will give the 5-fold accuracies of the reddit_train data set.
#**NOTE**: I have implemented the matrix operation instead of for loops in predict() method to decrease the run-time. However, the model is still quite slow
#Takes Around 25mins to run the 5-fold
